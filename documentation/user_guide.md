## Tips for Effective Use

1. **For day trading**: Use shorter timeframes (1d) with smaller intervals (1m, 5m)
2. **For long-term analysis**: Use longer timeframes (1y, 5y) with daily or weekly intervals
3. **For technical analysis**: Enable relevant indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands
4. **For performance comparison**: Add benchmark indices like ^GSPC (S&P 500) or ^DJI (Dow Jones)
5. **For portfolio tracking**: Add all your holdings to the watchlist for quick monitoring

## Troubleshooting

- If a stock symbol doesn't load, verify it's a valid symbol on Yahoo Finance
- For real-time data, ensure you have a stable internet connection
- If charts appear empty, try changing the timeframe or interval
- If the dashboard becomes slow, reduce the number of comparison stocks or indicators

## Data Sources

All stock data is provided by Yahoo Finance API, with data refreshing automatically every minute.
